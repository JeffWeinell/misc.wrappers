\title{Run tess3r and plot results

This is a wrapper for several functions from the tess3r package. The benefit of using this function is that data can be supplied as a VCF file, and results are plotted in multiple useful ways.}
\usage{
runtess(
  vcf,
  coords = NULL,
  Krange = 1:40,
  ploidy = 2,
  mask = 0.05,
  reps = 100,
  max.iteration = 500,
  save.as = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf}{Path to input VCF file with SNP data}

\item{coords}{Either a character string with path to file containing coordinates (longitude in first column, latitude in second column), or matrix object with longitude and latitude columns.}

\item{Krange}{Numerical vector with set of values to use for K.}

\item{ploidy}{Number of copies of each chromosome. Default 2.}

\item{mask}{Proportion of input data to mask during each replicate when tess3 function is called}

\item{reps}{Number of repititions. Default 100.}

\item{max.iteration}{Max iterations. Default 500.}

\item{save.as}{Where to save the output PDF. Default is NULL.}
}
\value{
List of plots
